				The current page is the default page each user first sees when he gets to your portal. By default, unauthenticated users are Guest users, so they are redirected to the guest community: <a href="/web/guest/">@portal_url@/web/guest/</a>

			<p>
				You can create any number of organizations or communities within the portal which will have their own public and private pages. One organization called <a href="/web/7cogs">7cogs</a> has already been created.
