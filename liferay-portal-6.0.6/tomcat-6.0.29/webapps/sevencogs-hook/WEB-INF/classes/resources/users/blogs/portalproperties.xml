<p>
	In my previous entry I told you how I could manage the entire portal from the Control Panel.
</p>

<p>
	In this entry I wanted to show you how you can configure the preferences of your portal.
</p>

<p>
	There is a file called <strong>portal.properties</strong> with all the parameters you can configure for your portal. Please be advised, you should not modify this file. Instead, create a portal-ext.properties file and you can overwrite these properties there (<a href="/web/guest/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/What+is+the+ext+environment" target="_blank">More information about this here</a>).
</p>

<p>
	Have a look at this file to see everything you can do. You will probably find this page very useful:<a href="http://www.liferay.com/web/guest/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Portal+Properties+5.1.1" target="_blank">www.liferay.com/web/guest/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Portal+Properties+5.1.1</a>
