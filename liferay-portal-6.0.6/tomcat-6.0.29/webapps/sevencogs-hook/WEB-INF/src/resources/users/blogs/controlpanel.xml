	I am very excited about this! Administrating the portal with a few clicks is now very easy, you just have to acces the Control Panel in the dock menu (top right) to do any of the following things:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Manage users, organizations and communities
	</li>
	<li>
		Create or assign roles
	</li>
	<li>
		Manage the content (Articles, blogs, wikis...)
	</li>
	<li>
		Add new plugins
	</li>
	<li>
		Update my account
	</li>
	<li>
		Change the settings of the portal and the server
	</li>
	<li>
		...
	</li>
</ul>

	Did I tell you how much I love being the Administrator since I have this amazing Control Panel? <img alt="" src="/html/js/editor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/teeth_smile.gif" />
